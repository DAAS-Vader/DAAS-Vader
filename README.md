# DAAS-Vader
A cloud computing project that provides computer resources using Kubernetes source code.

Resource mediation is performed on-chain via Suinetwork, and guarantees are received in a staking format.

The code is uploaded to Walrus, and resource providers run it on their own computers (nodes).

Load balancing uses the functionality of Kubernetes.

The goal is to operate mainly based on npm.
